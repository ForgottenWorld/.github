# ForgottenWorld Security Policy

If you discover a security issue, please report it by sending a
message to our developers https://forum.forgottenworld.it/g/sviluppatore.  
This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to security@forgottenworld.it.

Thanks for helping make ForgottenWorld safe for everyone.
